# Leo Zhang

I'm a sixth-form student in the UK. I like mathematics and building software
that proves its own results — the kind where you can check the claim yourself
instead of taking my word for it. That one idea runs through everything here:
a puzzle generator that must prove a puzzle sound before emitting it, a
consensus protocol whose safety properties are machine-checked, a renderer
validated against what the physics predicts, and new terms for the OEIS that
ship with their certificates.

## Mixed van der Waerden numbers

I have been computing new terms in families of mixed van der Waerden numbers
whose OEIS entries were last extended by Tanbir Ahmed in 2012 and were still
unchanged when I checked them against the OEIS API on 29 July 2026.

For colour targets `t_1..t_r` and a budget of `j` wildcards,

```
w(j+r; 2^j, t_1..t_r) = 1 + max{ n : [1,n] splits into j singleton classes and
                                 r colour classes, where colour class i contains
                                 no t_i-term arithmetic progression }
```

Each new term needs two independent halves. The lower bound is a colouring, and
a colouring is a certificate — you read the string and apply the definition, no
solver involved. The upper bound asserts that *no* colouring exists, which is
only as trustworthy as the encoding behind it, so that half is where the work is.

**Status, stated exactly.**

- Five new terms established across five families, each shipping evidence
  alongside the claim rather than a solver's word for it.
- **All five are in the OEIS, approved between 6 and 13 August 2026:**
  A217058 a(12) = 57, A217005 a(19) = 52, A217007 a(7) = 68,
  A217236 a(4) = 84 and A217059 a(9) = 74.
- The headline refutation is reduced to formally checked proof objects — 4,487
  per-cube DRAT proofs, each replayed to `s VERIFIED` by `drat-trim`, plus a
  checked proof that the cube set is exhaustive. **The other four upper bounds
  rest on cross-checked solver verdicts rather than on checked proofs**, and
  the write-up says exactly that.

Method, encoding, symmetry breaking and the limits of what has actually been
proved are written up in [MathRecords](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/MathRecords).
The standalone certificate verifier depends on nothing but the Python standard
library.

## What I build

Roughly one idea, applied repeatedly: a result is worth what its verification is
worth. Each of these is public, and each is built so that what it claims can be
checked rather than believed.

- **[QuantumCompiler](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/QuantumCompiler)** — a
  compiler for quantum circuits, its transformations stated as properties that
  are tested rather than asserted.
- **[DeterministicRaft](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/DeterministicRaft)** — an implementation of
  the Raft consensus protocol whose safety properties are machine-checked under
  deterministic simulation, so a violation reproduces from a seed instead of
  appearing once and vanishing.
- **[Splitbrain](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/Splitbrain)** — a
  distributed-systems test harness in Go that drives a real key-value cluster
  through seeded network partitions and machine-checks whether what the clients
  saw was even possible, with the linearizability checker validated against a
  brute-force oracle.
- **[Osmium](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/Osmium)** — an operating system for
  x86_64, written from scratch in Rust. It boots on BIOS and UEFI and
  preemptively schedules user programs in ring 3, each in its own address
  space, with fault isolation proven in CI by a program that page-faults
  beside a healthy one and is terminated alone. It has a shell and a RAM-only
  filesystem, and its privacy properties are enforced by boot-time self-tests
  rather than promised — no network stack exists, freed memory is zeroed, and
  every CI boot checksums the disk image around a run that deliberately
  creates files, so nothing can quietly reach the disk.
- **[PathTracer](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/PathTracer)** — a physically
  based renderer written with no dependencies, validated against what the physics
  predicts in advance.
- **[QuantumClaimReferee](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/QuantumClaimReferee)** — a checker
  for statistical claims, aimed at the gap between a number being computed and a
  number being meaningful.
- **[ChessPuzzleForge](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/ChessPuzzleForge)** — chess tooling:
  an engine, an analyser, and a puzzle generator that must prove a puzzle sound
  before it will emit it.
- **[TerminalAgent](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/TerminalAgent)** — a
  terminal-based agent, built around the question of what such a thing should
  refuse to do.
- **[EndeavourRacing](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/EndeavourRacing)** — the
  web applications for a student motorsport team: the marketing site, a lap-time
  prediction tool, and a project, risk and budget dashboard.
- **[TradingEngineResearch](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/TradingEngineResearch)** —
  the research core of a systematic trading platform: a fail-closed engine, a
  default-deny validation gate, and a pre-registered alpha search whose honest
  result was negative.
- **[MeltSim](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/MeltSim)** — an interactive
  thermodynamics sandbox: enthalpy-method melting, solidification and boiling in
  the browser, with zero runtime dependencies.
- **[IaCScanner](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/IaCScanner)** — an offline
  infrastructure-as-code misconfiguration scanner: Terraform, Kubernetes,
  Actions and Dockerfile rule packs, SARIF output, and a fail-only-on-new CI
  baseline.
- **[DocRedact](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/DocRedact)** — a local-first,
  policy-driven document redaction CLI that never sends a document anywhere.
- **[VisionCheckR](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/VisionCheckR)** — a
  privacy-first educational vision self-check that runs entirely in the browser,
  with a pure, unit-tested scoring core. Not a medical device.
- **[Understudy](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/Understudy)** — an
  interview rehearsal studio that runs entirely in the browser: on-device
  face and speech analysis with an annotated replay of your answer. The
  privacy claim is enforced rather than promised — a CI test records a real
  session and fails the build if any request leaves the origin. Live at
  [leo-y-zhang.github.io/Understudy](https://leo-y-zhang.github.io/Understudy/).
- **[ClimateMesh](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/ClimateMesh)** — a Raspberry
  Pi environmental sensing mesh with explainable early-warning risk scoring,
  built by two sixth-form students for the PA Raspberry Pi Competition 2026.
- **[FireTurret](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/FireTurret)** — a camera-guided
  fire-suppression turret demonstrator: simulation, vision and safety interlocks
  behind one supervised control loop, with the safety case written down.
- **[FilingsLab](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/FilingsLab)** — an SEC-filings
  event-study backtester: disclosure ingestion, deflation-robust validation, and
  a research loop that must prove an edge before believing it.

Some work stays private: a live web application with real users, and the
live-trading side of the platform whose research core is published above.
Neither is private for want of finishing.

Mostly Python and TypeScript, with SAT solvers, DRAT/LRAT proof checking, and
whatever numerical method the problem happens to need.

## Currently

The same machine-checkable approach applied to other integer sequences.
[GraphRecords](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/GraphRecords) turns bishop
arrangements into rook arrangements and has put fourteen new terms into seven
OEIS sequences on board graphs.
[RadoRecords](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/RadoRecords) carries the 2-colour
Rado numbers for `x_1^2 + ... + x_n^2 = z^2` from a(30) to a(60) with
DRAT-certified refutations — all thirty terms, a(31) through a(60), approved
and published in the OEIS.
[Refute](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/Refute) is the second opinion on those
certificates: an independent DRAT/LRAT checker in Rust, with a browser
playground where the files never leave the tab.
[OEISHeadroom](https://github.com/Leo-Y-Zhang/OEISHeadroom) asks a different
question — which sequences stop where a brute force ran out of patience rather
than where the mathematics gets hard — and then extends them. Seventy-one new
terms across A319381, A323586 and A325555 were approved on 31 August 2026, each
gated on a program that first reproduces every already-published term of its
sequence.
